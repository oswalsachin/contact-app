#Approach to complete the assignment
I am a strong believer of smart worker vs. hard worker, so always on the lookout for options to NOT reinvent the wheel.
Once I read the assignment details, I decided to host it as a website rather than sharing the solution and asking you guy to build/run it. So I googled for free .Net hosting platform and choose Microsoft Azure. I signed up for their trial account and started with sample web app, as part of their tutorial I came across a sample .Net and SQL using Azure App services. Fortunately it was very similar to our project requirement, after confirming the license details (free to use) I downloaded the app and made relevant changes to complete the assignment. So in all honesty, this is not "from scratch" development however I have refernced the below sample application to start with. I believe "referring" sample code/projects on the internet is no harm unless you completely understand what is being done, and can take charge of modifying it going forward. With this approach I was able to code, build, deploy and publish in just couple of hours which otherwise would have taken lot more time.
